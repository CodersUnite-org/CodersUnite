# About Coders Unite!
**If you're not against us, you're with us!**  

At Coders Unite!, we believe that the tech industry thrives when its workers thrive. Yet too often, developers, engineers, and digital creators face systemic exploitation: unpaid overtime ("crunch culture"), wage suppression, surveillance-driven productivity metrics, and the erosion of creative autonomy. We’re building a new kind of collective—part guild, part community, part movement—to fight wage theft, attention theft, and the isolation of modern tech work.

## Why Coders Unite?
Tech workers built the digital world—but too often, the value we create rarely returns to us. Profit-driven metrics pit us against each other while executives hoard the value we create. By uniting as a guild, we:

- Turn isolated grievances into systemic change
- Make the 1% pay their 1%.
- Replace competitive secrecy with collaborative transparency
- Transform "lone wolf" coding culture into lasting community
