# Monetization

## Open collective (Offering Plate)
*Transparency First*
**How it works*
- Public ledger of all donations/expenses.
- Members choose their tier. For example $5/month patron to $50/month full solidarity patron.
- Funds can go to things like hosting costs, legal defense pools, advertising, etc...

**Pros:**
- No Dark Money
- Might be tax deductible if we can get non-profit status.
- Follows transparency goals.
- Using GItHub Sponsorships can eliminate platform fees.

**Cons**
- Tragedy of the commons maybe.
- Platform fees to things like Patreon, ko-fi, etc...

## Sliding-Scale Membership (Tithes)
**How it works**
- Members pay a percentage of monthly income .5% to 5%.
- Freelancers pay when gigs close; salaried auto-donate
- public dashboard of collections.

**Pros**
- Lowers costs of underpaid members.
- Follows transparency if implemented right.

**Cons**
- Relies on honor system
- Could be hard to automate.

## Corporate Exploitation (Guilt Tax)
**How it works**
- Companies pay us to be listed as "Less Exploitative Employers"
- Tiered verification:
	- Copper: Gets a stamp/logo that they support our cause ($100/mo)
	- Bronze: Publishes their salary bands and paygrades ($250/mo)
	- Gold: Third-party auditors check work culture and audit company practices ($1k/mo)
**Pros**
- Makes the 1 percent pay their percent.
- Incentivizes employer reform.
- Turns transparency into revenue.

**Cons**
- Greenwashes employers who may not be wiling to change.
