# Guild Job Board

We’re dismantling the toxic hiring culture of fake listings and bait-and-switch tactics. Our job board combines community vigilance with hard transparency requirements to protect coders.

## How It Works: No Ghosts, No Games

### **Pre-Vetted Listings**  
Employers **must** provide:  
- **Real salary ranges** (no "DOE" allowed)  
- **Team/role specificity** (no vague "full-stack ninja" postings)  
- **Contract previews** (show key clauses like IP ownership, non-compete)  
- **Hiring timeline** (auto-expires after 30 days unless updated)
- **Free Job Postings** (We won't charge you to post, but we will vet your listing.)
- **NO RECRUITING COMPANIES** (Our goal is to remove middle men from this process and improve transparency. We will not accept listings from recruiting agencies.)

Companies failing these rules get flagged as **"High Exploitation Risk"**.

## For Job Seekers  

### **Ghost Job Busters**  
- **Stale Posting Alerts**: Listings unchanged >45 days get a *"Still hiring?"* badge.  
- **Employer Accountability Dashboard**: See companies’ historical data:  
  | Metric                | Example           |  
  |-----------------------|-------------------|  
  | Avg. time-to-hire     | 22 days           |  
  | % Roles filled        | 87%               |  
  | Member-reported bait-and-switch | 2 incidents |  

### **Bait-and-Switch Protection**  
- **Interview Transcripts**: Members anonymously share offer vs. reality discrepancies.  
- **Contract Radar**: AI compares final contracts to original posting’s terms.  
- **Upvote/Downvote System**: Members rate postings on clarity and honesty.  
- **Burner Accounts Welcome**: Submit sensitive warnings anonymously.  

### **Transparency Tools**  
- **Salary Sandworm**: Compare the posted range to our anonymous database.  
- **Glassdoor++**: See if current/past employees at the company are guild members willing to chat.
