# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

   At Coders Unite!, we believe that the tech industry thrives when its workers thrive.
   Yet too often, developers, engineers, and digital creators face systemic exploitation: unpaid overtime ("crunch culture"), wage suppression, surveillance-driven productivity metrics, and the erosion of creative autonomy.
   We’re building a new kind of collective—part guild, part community, part movement—to fight wage theft, attention theft, and the isolation of modern tech work.
